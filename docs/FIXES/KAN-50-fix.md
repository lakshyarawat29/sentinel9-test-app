# Auto-Generated Fix for KAN-50

## Culprit Commit
`55ee6a8d9ad8fa7eaa3f5813f212fa2e5450126e`

## AI Analysis
The commit reduced the database connection pool max from 20 to 2, which could lead to a significant increase in connection contention and waiting times. This change could cause memory exhaustion due to the increased number of waiting threads or connections, especially if the application is not designed to handle such a low connection pool size. The commit message itself mentions a potential issue with timeouts, which could be a contributing factor to the memory exhaustion.

## Recommended Fix
```
Revert the connection pool size change to its original value (max: 20) or adjust it to a more suitable value based on the application's requirements and performance characteristics.
```
