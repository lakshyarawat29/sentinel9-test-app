## AI Analysis
The commit with hash f8114d3715447f47a02803be7ac4708810e0e1af changed the database pool settings, reducing the maximum pool size from 20 to 3 and the acquire timeout from 30000ms to 5000ms. This change could lead to a database timeout in production, especially if the application experiences a high volume of requests. The reduced pool size and acquire timeout can cause the database connections to be exhausted or timed out, resulting in a timeout error.

## Recommended Fix
```
Revert the changes made in commit f8114d3715447f47a02803be7ac4708810e0e1af to restore the original database pool settings. Specifically, change the 'max' value back to 20 and the 'acquireTimeoutMillis' value back to 30000 in the config/database.js file.
