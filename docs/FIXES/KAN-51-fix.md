# Auto-Generated Fix for KAN-51

## Culprit Commit
`55ee6a8d9ad8fa7eaa3f5813f212fa2e5450126e`

## AI Analysis
The commit reduced the database connection pool max from 20 to 2 connections, which is likely to cause the database connection pool to be exhausted, especially under heavy load. This change directly correlates with the reported production incident of API timeouts due to an exhausted database connection pool. The commit message itself mentions optimizing for cost savings, but it does not consider the potential impact on performance and capacity to handle requests.

## Recommended Fix
```
Revert the changes made to the database connection pool settings. Specifically, increase the 'max' value back to 20 or a suitable number that can handle the expected load without causing timeouts. For example: 
   pool: {
       min: 2,
       max: 20,
       acquireTimeoutMillis: 5000,
       idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
   }
```
