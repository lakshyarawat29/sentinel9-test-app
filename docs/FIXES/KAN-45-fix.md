# Auto-Generated Fix for KAN-45

## Culprit Commit
`3a2ab988284fc6050c8115cab269f21082aa7172`

## AI Analysis
The commit introduces a caching layer with a known memory leak bug. The cache does not clean up expired entries, causing memory usage to increase over time. This matches the incident description of production memory exhaustion and API server OOM crashes. The bug is explicitly mentioned in the commit message and the code diff shows the missing cleanup logic.

## Recommended Fix
```
Add a periodic cleanup call to the CacheService, e.g., using setInterval(this.cleanup, 60000) in the constructor, or call cleanup() at the end of the set() method. Alternatively, consider using a more robust caching library that handles expiration and cleanup automatically.
```
